# Front-End Development Standards at Canto de Minas

This document establishes the front-end development standards at Canto de Minas, aiming to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in projects. It is crucial for the longevity of systems, ensuring that, in a hypothetical scenario of team changes, there is a structured guide to support the transition and maintain work continuity. The practices and standards here should be defined, maintained, and evolved by the team, always through collaborative discussions and consensus, reflecting project needs and promoting continuous improvement.

## Stack

### JavaScript Library/Framework

- **React:** Chosen for its efficiency, flexibility, broad community support, and being the technology the team is most proficient in.

### Language

- **TypeScript:** Used to add static typing to JavaScript, increasing code reliability and maintenance.

### State Management

- **Context:** Chosen for being native to React, simpler than robust solutions like Redux, and sufficient for the team's needs.

### Routing

- **React Router DOM:** Chosen as the standard for React projects and the solution the team is most accustomed to.

### HTTP Requests

- **Axios:** Used for making HTTP requests, mainly due to the ability to configure interceptors and handle HTTP-only cookies.
- **TanStack Query:** Chosen for its efficiency in request management, encapsulating them and allowing caching, along with various extra configurations.

### CSS Framework

- **Tailwind:** Used for its widespread popularity, ensuring reliability, and its utility-first design approach.

### Front-End Tooling

- **Vite:** Chosen as a replacement for the deprecated create-react-app, offering a good solution without a steep learning curve.

### Component Library

- **shadcn-ui:** Adopted for its accessible and easily customizable components, natively working with Tailwind.

### Testing

- **Cypress:** Used for end-to-end testing.
- **Jest:** Chosen for unit and integration testing with TypeScript support. (still under consideration)
- **React Testing Library:** Implemented for being native to React, facilitating the creation of more natural tests.

### Utility Libraries

- **date-fns:** Used for date manipulation, addressing inconsistencies in JavaScript date conversions.
- **react-dropzone:** Adopted for implementing drag-and-drop file areas.
- **swiper:** Chosen for creating modern and interactive carousels.
- *(define library for input masks)*

### Linting and Formatting Tools

- **Prettier:** Implemented to ensure code format consistency.
- **Tailwind Intellisense:** Used to assist in development with Tailwind CSS.
- **ESLint:** For more advanced code standardization configurations.

### Version Control System

- **GitHub:** Chosen for being the most popular and familiar platform for the team.

### CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions:** Adopted for CI/CD automation, facilitating continuous integration and delivery. (still under consideration)
